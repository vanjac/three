# three

three is a 3d game engine with a map editor, written in Python and with Python scripting. See the [wiki](https://github.com/vanjac/three/wiki) for installation instructions and documentation.

three uses Sphinx for documentation. Install it with `pip3 install sphinx`. To build the docs, in the `docs` directory run `make html`. The index page will be at `docs/_build/html/index.html`.

*I don't recommend using this, I didn't know what I was doing when I wrote it.*
